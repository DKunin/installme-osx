# My personal scripts to setup a new OSX

These are just my personal scripts to help me setup a new osx machine. They are very opinionated and probably very wrong.

To start a new setup, simply run:

```shell
bash -c "`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruyadorno/installme-osx/master/setup.sh`"
```
